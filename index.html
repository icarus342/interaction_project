	<br>
	<br>This simulation of agents is a scenario where there are 3 types of 
	agents listed above. No other agents know what type other agents are.
	Agents use a trust system to determine who they can trust. Each agent
	keeps track of their trust of other agents. Killers will try to kill
	all other agents on the map (except other killers). They try to pick off
	agents that are not surrounded by many other agents. Sheriffs will shoot
	and kill anybody they do not trust. If they witness a murder from a killer,
	this spikes the trust negatively and they will pursue the killer. Killers
	do not know who the sheriffs are, so they hope they get lucky with finding
	them first. As there are less agents on the bored, killers get more bold.
	They use a variation of the multiplicative inverse of the amount of agents
	on the board to determine their threshold for agents in visual range when
	they commit a murder.
	<br>
	<br><b>Trust</b>
	<br>Individual trust can be raised or lower through certain triggers. If
	an agent can't "see" another agent, they lose trust on that agent. If
	they can see that agent, they gain trust. If trust has fallen negative
	for another agent, it will always keep going lower, just at a slower
	rate if they're in visual range. Agents also like to gossip about other
	agents. If agents are in range, they will share their trust ratings with other
	agents to influence their trust scores.
	<br>The higher the trust is, the more likely the agent will follow the
	agent they trust. If it is negative, the higher magnitude of the negative,
	the more likely the agent will run away in the other direction.
	<br>If any agents witness a murder, they have a massive negative spike on
	that agent and will run away and inform other agents. Since no agents trust
	other agents, they take some convincing.
	<br>
	<br><b>About</b>
	<br>The only code I used that was not mine was GameEngine, Entity and AssetManager.
	<br>
	<br>This was a very interesting simulation. When I had slightly higher % chance to follow formula 
	(  Math.log10(trustValue * 0.05 + 2.7) * 100  ) I noticed that agents would form groups with other
	agents that they trusted. They would then stick to their group and avoid other groups. A very
	interesting simulation where you don't know who you can trust, so you feel more comfortable with
	large groups, and groups with people you are familiar with.

	<br> <b>Bug:</b> Some collisions are not perfect
